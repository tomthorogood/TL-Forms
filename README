===============================
REQUIREMENTS

In order to use TL Forms, you must have the following:
    jQuery (jquery.com)
    jQuery UI (for the slide animation, and some color animations) (jqueryui.com)

Certain implementations also require other libraries:
    The jQuery form plugin (for ajaxSubmit): http://jquery.malsup.com/form/
    The TL Overlay class (http://www.turnleftllc.com/api/tl_overlay.js)

================================
SETUP:

If you're on linux, run build.sh in the tools/ directory. You must have Java 6 in order to do so.
This will combine all the necessary files and minimize them, placing the dev version in dev/ and the minified version in min/.

If you're on windows, run concat.py, and then minify.py. Concat combines all the files in src, and minify minifies that output.
Most likely, this won't even be necessary, as this utility should be run before each push into the repository, but just in case...

The base use is fairly straightforward. The following must be included in your HTML code:
<script type="text/javascript" src="[[path to jquery]]"></script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="[[path to jquery ui]]"></script>
<!--optional, but recommended
<script type="text/javascript" src="tl_overlay.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="jquery.form.js"></script>
-->
<script type="text/javascript" path/to/min/="tl_forms.js"></script>

===============================

CLASSES:

Parse: Parses strings and separates them into values for the Form class. 
 -> in such cases, a double colon serves as the delimiter: 03::My Option::Selected
Form: Creates DOM elements and sets their values
validator: Validates fields
form_widget: Implements, builds, and renders the form.
